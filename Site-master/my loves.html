		<p>Here is my first and only car so far. I love it more than life itself. It is a 1997 Honda Prelude which is very rare. When I got it it required alot of body and engine work that my dad and I did over the course of a summer four years ago. It is very clean and the inside looks brand new even though it is 20 years old. A year after it was fixed I got rear ended and the car was totaled. I could not let it go so again my dad and I rebuilt it with a salvaged title. Everything underneath the car was redone to pass inspection and since then I drive it everyday with absolutely no issues. I really enjoy the attention I get from people who have a good eye for JDM vehicles. </p>
		<p>My other love is hip hop music. Below is my favorite album by Tyler the Creator. The production and lyrical themes of the album is what makes it special to me.</p>
